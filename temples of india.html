            <h2>2.Sringeri Sharadamba Temple</h2>
            <p style="font-size: large;">Sri Sharadamba Temple (ಶೃಂಗೇರಿ ಶಾರದಾಂಬೆ) is a famous Hindu temple dedicated to goddess Saraswati in the holy town of Sringeri in Karnataka, India.
               The Sharadamba Temple at Sringeri (Shringa giri in Sanskrit) is an 8th-century temple, founded by Sri Adi Shankaracharya. It housed a sandalwood statue of Shardamba in a standing posture, which was installed by Adi Shankarachaya until the Vijayanagara rulers and Sri Vidyaranya (12th Jagadguru) installed a seated gold statue of Sri Shardamba in the 14th century.
               Sankara is believed to have envisioned this place as the holiest where a snake hooded as an umbrella to protect a pregnant frog from hot Sun during its labour.To commemorate this incident, a sculpture known as KAPPE SHANKARA is there on the footsteps to the river Tunga. This was the first place where Sankara is believed to have established one of the four major mutts.
               As per Hindu legend, the place is associated with sage Rishyasringa, son of Vibhandakamuni. He did severe penance at this place, leading to the name Sringeri.
                The temple was renovated during the regime of Vijayanagara Empire during the 14-16th centuries and later during 1916.
